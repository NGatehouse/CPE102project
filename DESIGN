Create a plain text document named DESIGN. This document must give an overview of your class/method design. Specifically, for each class, list the name and methods (without parameters) now associated with the class as shown below (do not list the data attributes).

In addition, list each of the functions that was not turned into a method and give a brief justification for why this function remains as a function. For instance, activity_loop in controller.py might remain a function because there is no logical class with which it is associated and because it is used as part of the pygame setup.

class: Class Name
methods:
   method1
   method2
   ...
