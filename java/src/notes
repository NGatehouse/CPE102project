Hi Nick,

I found the best way to add files is to do the following:

1. Right click on "src" > New > Java Class
2. Name the class
3. Copy and paste Java file into the empty project class file

Once we both have our files in the project, then we should be able to
 use Git to seamlessly sync files.

Also, when you "add" files with Git, you will probably want to use 
Thanks!
