Hi Nick,

I found the best way to add files is to do the following:

1. Right click on "src" > New > Java Class
2. Name the class
3. Copy and paste Java file into the empty project class file

Once we both have our files in the project, then we should be able to
 use Git to seamlessly sync files.

Also, when I "added" the files to our repository, I had to use the following command.
I am not sure if we will continue to have to use it. There probably is a recursive way to do this.

    git add java/* java/.idea/* java/.idea/.name/*

To add all files and subdirectories, recursively:

    git add .

To add all files except workspace.xml and then commit

    git add . && git rm -f java/.idea/workspace.xml && git commit
    git add . ; git rm -f java/.idea/workspace.xml ; git commit

Thanks!
Luke
