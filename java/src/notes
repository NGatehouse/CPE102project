Your translated project will not include the builder portion of the original project. Your translation is not
required to include the colored square under the mouse pointer.


1. GUI (WorldView.py)
    - No Mouse hover functionality
    - mouse_buttons.py is just enums
    - key.py is dictionary

Hi Nick,

I found the best way to add files is to do the following:

1. Right click on "src" > New > Java Class
2. Name the class
3. Copy and paste Java file into the empty project class file

Once we both have our files in the project, then we should be able to
 use Git to seamlessly sync files.

Also, when I "added" the files to our repository, I had to use the following command.
I am not sure if we will continue to have to use it. There probably is a recursive
way to do this.

    git add java/* java/.idea/* java/.idea/.name/*

To add all files and subdirectories, recursively:

    git add .

To add all files except workspace.xml and then commit

    git add . && git rm -f java/.idea/workspace.xml && git commit
    git add . ; git rm -f java/.idea/workspace.xml ; git commit

To do all of above plus ignore "out" files:

    git add . && git rm -f -r java/.idea/workspace.xml &&  git rm -f -r java/out/*  && git commit
    git add . ; git rm -f -r java/.idea/workspace.xml ; git rm -f -r java/out/*  ; git commit

Thanks!
Luke

questions:
1. how to make a constant in java... mining, vein.  do they get passed on through inheritance or no?
2. ask about minernotfull/minerfull... specifically return([entity_pt], False)   just return True or False
4. actions.py sign and adjacent should we implement now? it affects next_position and blob_next_position in worldmodel
5. background and occupancy 2d array.

you can also in this part of the code make a list of entity.. compute distances as

next questions 5/11:
1. how should i represent item in OrderedList.java, also line 22 confusion... define an interface called action that has the action method as a contract
2. in image store there is alot of pygame. references. where do i look for that , look at processing  look at lab,  for everything talks about pygame function called blit
3. are we going to be going over file I/O in class or should i teach my self that in java? scanner link in assignment 4
4. in image_store.py says images = {} empty dictionay? ... what is {}? represented in java... look in one of these labs
5. attrs is that an ArrayList of type String? String []
6. ListItem, should i be redefining equals method?
7. what is hasattr in Action_manager.py? // in java instance of check,
8. says i need to declare something abstract to use an interface? "Quake"

next Q's 5/12:
1. if On_Grid implements action_manager... will those methods defined in On_Grid be inherited by everything else? or will the code know the difference between the interface contracted methods and the class defined methods.
