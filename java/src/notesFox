Grid is 20 wide by 15 tall
    with a double width and double height possible,
    making 4 20x15 quadrants

Do we need controller.py
    key stuff looks like keyPressed() in Processing (so in Main.java?)
    activity_loop() looks like draw() in Processing (so in Main.java?)
    Only thing is handle_timer_event(). Where to put it?

Should have a Main.java file?

Tick vs. Time milliseconds? Int or long?

  public returnType update_on_time(Ticks ticks)
    {
        tile = new ArrayList<>();  //says can't resolve "tile"
