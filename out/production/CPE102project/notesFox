Grid is 20 wide by 15 tall
    with a double width and double height possible,
    making 4 20x15 quadrants

Do we need controller.py
    key stuff looks like keyPressed() in Processing (so in Main.java?)
    activity_loop() looks like draw() in Processing (so in Main.java?)
    Only thing is handle_timer_event(). Where to put it?

Should have a Main.java file?

Tick vs. Time milliseconds? Int or long?

  public returnType update_on_time(Ticks ticks)
    {
        tile = new ArrayList<>();  //says can't resolve "tile"

        //Instead of redrawing each tile like in Python, we redraw the World
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If (WorldModel) add_entity planned on only updating tiles that have ents that move,
but this will need to take in objects that are anything, such as obstacles.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

- World_Model.java  add_entity  Action_manager or On_Grid..casting??
- What type is i_store? (in MinerNotFull.java  create_actor_motion)  //Was dictionary... Map is interface and Hashmap is class to use
   - What does   (tiles,found)  mean?  // Ignore tiles part, so just "found = ..."
- Main.java  create_default_background()
